## 1. Clone a repo:

1.  Open the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Metal-subsidy-stress/github-playground)
2.  Click Green "\<\> Code" box and select "Local"
3.  Select either HTTPS or SSH (depending on your setup) and copy the link
4.  Open RStudio and select "Project: None" -\> "New Project"
5.  Select "Version Control" -\> "Git" -\> and paste the link to the "Repository URL" box
6.  Give the directory a unique name in "Project directory name"
    -   This will be the folder name on your local machine
7.  Select a directory where this folder will live
    -   I recommend you do **NOT** use a cloud location (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive) as the duplicate version control can cause issues
